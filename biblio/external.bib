	shorttitle = {Evolutionary Dynamics},
	abstract = {At a time of unprecedented expansion in the life sciences, evolution is the one theory that transcends all of biology. Any observation of a living system must ultimately be interpreted in the context of its evolution. Evolutionary change is the consequence of mutation and natural selection, which are two concepts that can be described by mathematical equations. Evolutionary Dynamics is concerned with these equations of life. In this book, Martin A. Nowak draws on the languages of biology and mathematics to outline the mathematical principles according to which life evolves. His work introduces readers to the powerful yet simple laws that govern the evolution of living systems, no matter how complicated they might seem. Evolution has become a mathematical theory, Nowak suggests, and any idea of an evolutionary process or mechanism should be studied in the context of the mathematical equations of evolutionary dynamics. His book presents a range of analytical tools that can be used to this end: fitness landscapes, mutation matrices, genomic sequence space, random drift, quasispecies, replicators, the Prisoner’s Dilemma, games in finite and infinite populations, evolutionary graph theory, games on grids, evolutionary kaleidoscopes, fractals, and spatial chaos. Nowak then shows how evolutionary dynamics applies to critical real-world problems, including the progression of viral diseases such as {AIDS}, the virulence of infectious agents, the unpredictable mutations that lead to cancer, the evolution of altruism, and even the evolution of human language. His book makes a clear and compelling case for understanding every living system—and everything that arises as a consequence of living systems—in terms of evolutionary dynamics.},

	abstract = {Condensation phenomena arise through a collective behaviour of particles. They are observed in both classical and quantum systems, ranging from the formation of traffic jams in mass transport models to the macroscopic occupation of the energetic ground state in ultra-cold bosonic gases (Bose-Einstein condensation). Recently, it has been shown that a driven and dissipative system of bosons may form multiple condensates. Which states become the condensates has, however, remained elusive thus far. The dynamics of this condensation are described by coupled birth-death processes, which also occur in evolutionary game theory. Here we apply concepts from evolutionary game theory to explain the formation of multiple condensates in such driven-dissipative bosonic systems. We show that the vanishing of relative entropy production determines their selection. The condensation proceeds exponentially fast, but the system never comes to rest. Instead, the occupation numbers of condensates may oscillate, as we demonstrate for a rock-paper-scissors game of condensates.},

The consequences of this theory are then developed for simple, illustrative geometries including the finite and semi-infinite intervals, fractal networks, spherical geometries and the wedge. Various applications are presented including neuron dynamics, self-organized criticality, diffusion-limited aggregation, the dynamics of spin systems and the kinetics of diffusion-controlled reactions. First-passage processes provide an appealing way for graduate students and researchers in physics, chemistry, theoretical biology, electrical engineering, chemical engineering, operations research and finance to understand all of these systems.},

The underlying mixed Dirichlet-Neumann boundary value problem is conformally mapped onto the unit disk, solved exactly, and mapped back. The resulting formula for the {MFPT} is valid for an arbitrary space-dependent diffusion coefficient, while the leading logarithmic term is explicit, simple, and remarkably universal. In contrast to earlier works, we show that the natural small parameter of the problem is the harmonic measure of the escape region, not its perimeter. The conventional scaling of the {MFPT} with the area of the domain is altered when diffusing particles are released near the escape region. These findings change the current view of escape problems and related chemical or biochemical kinetics in complex, multiscale, porous or fractal domains, while the fundamental relation to the harmonic measure opens new ways of computing and interpreting {MFPTs}.},

	abstract = {The first-passage time ({FPT}), i.e., the moment when a stochastic process reaches a given threshold value for the first time, is a fundamental mathematical concept with immediate applications. In particular, it quantifies the statistics of instances when biomolecules in a biological cell reach their specific binding sites and trigger cellular regulation. Typically, the first-passage properties are given in terms of mean first-passage times. However, modern experiments now monitor single-molecular binding-processes in living cells and thus provide access to the full statistics of the underlying first-passage events, in particular, inherent cell-to-cell fluctuations. We here present a robust explicit approach for obtaining the distribution of {FPTs} to a small partially reactive target in cylindrical-annulus domains, which represent typical bacterial and neuronal cell shapes. We investigate various asymptotic behaviours of this {FPT} distribution and show that it is typically very broad in many biological situations, thus, the mean {FPT} can differ from the most probable {FPT} by orders of magnitude. The most probable {FPT} is shown to strongly depend only on the starting position within the geometry and to be almost independent of the target size and reactivity. These findings demonstrate the dramatic relevance of knowing the full distribution of {FPTs} and thus open new perspectives for a more reliable description of many intracellular processes initiated by the arrival of one or few biomolecules to a small, spatially localised region inside the cell.},

Subjects (n=4,000) were embedded in networks (n=230) of 20 nodes to which we sometimes added 3 bots. The bots were programmed with varying levels of behavioral randomness and different geodesic locations. Here, we show that bots acting with small levels of random noise and placed in central locations meaningfully improve the collective performance of human groups, accelerating the median solution time by 55.6\%. This is especially the case when the coordination problem is hard. Behavioral randomness worked not only by making the task of humans to whom the bots were connected easier, but also by affecting the game play of the humans among themselves and hence creating further cascades of benefit in global coordination in these heterogeneous systems.},

Although information theory provides tools to quantify the information produced by a system, traditional metrics do not account for the inefficient ways that humans process this information. Here, we develop an analytical framework to study the information generated by a system as perceived by a human observer. We demonstrate experimentally that this perceived information depends critically on a system’s network topology. Applying our framework to several real networks, we find that they communicate a large amount of information (having high entropy) and do so efficiently (maintaining low divergence from human expectations). Moreover, we show that such efficient communication arises in networks that are simultaneously heterogeneous, with high-degree hubs, and clustered, with tightly connected modules—the two defining features of hierarchical organization. Together, these results suggest that many communication networks are constrained by the pressures of information transmission, and that these pressures select for specific structural features.},

It introduces readers to the art of stochastic modeling, shows how to design computer implementations, and provides extensive worked examples with case studies. Markov Chains: From Theory to Implementation and Experimentation begins with a general introduction to the history of probability theory in which the author uses quantifiable examples to illustrate how probability theory arrived at the concept of discrete-time and the Markov model from experiments involving independent variables. An introduction to simple stochastic matrices and transition probabilities is followed by a simulation of a two-state Markov chain. The notion of steady state is explored in connection with the long-run distribution behavior of the Markov chain. Predictions based on Markov chains with more than two states are examined, followed by a discussion of the notion of absorbing Markov chains. Also covered in detail are topics relating to the average time spent in a state, various chain configurations, and n-state Markov chain simulations used for verifying experiments involving various diagram configurations. - Fascinating historical notes shed light on the key ideas that led to the development of the Markov model and its variants - Various configurations of Markov Chains and their limitations are explored at length - Numerous examples'from basic to complex'are presented in a comparative manner using a variety of color graphics - All algorithms presented can be analyzed in either Visual Basic, Java Script, or {PHP} - Designed to be useful to professional statisticians as well as readers without extensive knowledge of probability theory Covering both the theory underlying the Markov model and an array of Markov chain implementations, within a common conceptual framework, Markov Chains: From Theory to Implementation and Experimentation is a stimulating introduction to and a valuable reference for those wishing to deepen their understanding of this extremely valuable statistical tool.

In terms of game theory, these processes can represent two players with opposite interests. The actions of the players are manifested by a series of strikes of random magnitudes imposed onto the opposite side and rendered at random times. Each of the assaults is aimed to inflict damage to vital areas. In contrast with some strictly antagonistic games where a game ends with one single successful hit, in the current setting, each side (player) can endure multiple strikes before perishing. Each player has a fixed cumulative threshold of tolerance which represents how much damage he can endure before succumbing. Each player will try to defeat the adversary at his earliest opportunity, and the time when one of them collapses is referred to as the “ruin time”. We predict the ruin time of each player, and the cumulative status of all related components for each player at ruin time. The actions of each player are formalized by a marked point process representing (an economic) status of each opponent at any given moment of time. Their marks are assumed to be weakly monotone, which means that each opposite side accumulates damages, but does not have the ability to recover. We render a time-sensitive analysis of a bivariate continuous time parameter process representing the status of each player at any given time and at the ruin time and obtain explicit formulas for related functionals.},

In two-players games, the competition between strategies corresponds to the capabilities of the corresponding traps in capturing the random walks originated by the aleatory components of the game. The concept of dominance transitivity of strategies implies an advantage for the first player, who can choose the strategy that, at least statistically, wins. However, in some games, the second player is statistically advantaged, so these games are denoted “intransitive”. In an intransitive game, the second player can choose a location for his/her trap which captures more random walks than that of the first one. The transitivity concept can, therefore, be extended to generic random walks and in general to Markov chains. We analyze random walks on several kinds of networks (rings, scale-free, hierarchical and city-inspired) with many variations: traps can be partially absorbing, the walkers can be biased and the initial distribution can be arbitrary. We found that the transitivity concept can be quite useful for characterizing the combined properties of a graph and that of the walkers.},

As a consequence, it is always possible to identify a suitable location for the second absorbing sink that screens at most the flux of agents directed against the first trap, whose position has been preliminarily assigned. The degree of mutual competition between pairs of nodes is analytically quantified through apt indicators that build on the topological characteristics of the hosting graph. Moreover, the positioning of the second trap can be chosen so as to minimize, at the same time, the probability of being in turn shaded by a thirdly added trap. Supervised placing of absorbing traps on a asymmetric disordered and complex graph is hence possible, as follows a robust optimization protocol. This latter is here discussed and successfully tested against synthetic data.},

In {SF} networks we reveal the significant impact of the trap's location: ρ(t) is drastically different when a trap is placed on a random node compared to the case of the trap being on the node with the maximum connectivity. For the latter case we find ρ(t) ∝ exp [−At/Nγ−2/γ−1 ⟨k⟩] for all γ{\textgreater} 2, where γ is the exponent of the degree distribution P(k)∝k- γ.},

	abstract = {We present computer-simulation results for the trapping rate (rate constant) k associated with diffusion-controlled reactions among identical, static spherical traps distributed with an arbitrary degree of impenetrability using a Pearson random-walk algorithm. We specifically consider the penetrable-concentric-shell model in which each trap of diameter σ is composed of a mutually impenetrable core of diameter λσ, encompassed by a perfectly penetrable shell of thickness (1-λ)σ/2: λ=0 corresponding to randomly centered or ‘‘fully penetrable’’ traps and λ=1 corresponding to totally impenetrable traps. Trapping rates are calculated accurately from the random-walk algorithm at the extreme limits of λ (λ=0 and 1) and at an intermediate value (λ=0.8), for a wide range of trap densities. Our simulation procedure has a relatively fast execution time. It is found that k increases with increasing impenetrability at fixed trap concentration. These ‘‘exact’’ data are compared with previous theories for the trapping rate. Although a good approximate theory exists for the fully-penetrable-trap case, there are no currently available theories that can provide good estimates of the trapping rate for a moderate to high density of traps with nonzero hard cores (λ{\textgreater}0).},

Using apps may help researchers to scale up the reach, precisely control randomization and experiment materials, collect a variety of objective and self-reported data over time, and more conveniently replicate and adapt an experiment. We performed a systematic review on field experiments involving apps published between 2007 and 2017. Seven databases were scanned using a predefined search strategy. The database search retrieved 4,810 citations; 101 articles met the inclusion criteria. Our review suggests that scholars have only started to employ apps in field experiments in the last 4 years. Most studies only used apps as an experiment treatment instead of an experiment platform; therefore, researchers have yet to fully leverage the advantages. Almost all studies were from the health research domain and 77.2\% used randomized controlled trial design. Only 7 studies utilized smartphone sensors for collecting data. Only one study reported cost and ethical concerns regarding using apps for the experiment. Given these findings, we reported a case study that targeted a minority racial group and leveraged the advantages of apps as an experiment platform and as a data collection tool to illustrate practical challenges and lessons learned regarding time, financial cost, and technical support. In conclusion, we suggest apps provide new ways to study causal mechanisms with experiment big data. Limitations of generalizability, retention, and design quality were discussed as well.},

Specifically, our findings from 8 different experimental economics games and tasks replicate existing results from traditional laboratory experiments despite the fact that subjects play those games/task in a specific order and regardless of whether the experiment was conducted in person or remotely. We further leverage our large subject population to study the effect of large (N = 100) versus small (N = 10) group sizes on behavior in three of the scalable games that we study. While our results are largely consistent with existing findings for small groups, increases in group size are shown to matter for the robustness of those findings.},

	abstract = {Jet lag arises from a misalignment of circadian biological timing with the timing of human activity, and is caused by rapid transmeridian travel. Jet lag's symptoms, such as depressed cognitive alertness, also arise from work and social schedules misaligned with the timing of the circadian clock. Using experimentally validated mathematical models, we develop a new methodology to find mathematically optimal schedules of light exposure and avoidance for rapidly re-entraining the human circadian system. In simulations, our schedules are found to significantly outperform other recently proposed schedules. Moreover, our schedules appear to be significantly more robust to both noise in light and to inter-individual variations in endogenous circadian period than other proposed schedules. By comparing the optimal schedules for thousands of different situations, and by using general mathematical arguments, we are also able to translate our findings into general principles of optimal circadian re-entrainment. These principles include: 1) a class of schedules where circadian amplitude is only slightly perturbed, optimal for dim light and for small shifts 2) another class of schedules where shifting occurs along the shortest path in phase-space, optimal for bright light and for large shifts 3) the determination that short light pulses are less effective than sustained light if the goal is to re-entrain quickly, and 4) the determination that length of daytime should be significantly shorter when delaying the clock than when advancing it.},

Method: A 13-week social media-based exercise program was conducted at a large Northeastern university in Philadelphia, {PA}. In a randomized controlled trial, 217 graduate students from the University were randomized to three conditions: a control condition with a basic online program for enrolling in weekly exercise classes led by instructors of the University for 13weeks, a media condition that supplemented the basic program with weekly online promotional media messages that encourage physical activity, and a social condition that replaced the media content with an online network of four to six anonymous peers composed of other participants of the program, in which each participant was able to see their peers' progress in enrolling in classes. The primary outcome was the number of enrollments in exercise classes, and the secondary outcomes were self-reported physical activities. Data were collected in 2014. Results: Participants enrolled in 5.5 classes on average. Compared with enrollment in the control condition (mean=4.5), promotional messages moderately increased enrollment (mean=5.7, p=0.08), while anonymous social networks significantly increased enrollment (mean=6.3, p=0.02). By the end of the program, participants in the social condition reported exercising moderately for an additional 1.6days each week compared with the baseline, which was significantly more than an additional 0.8days in the control condition. Conclusion: Social influence from anonymous online peers was more successful than promotional messages for improving physical activity.

Analysis of data collected from participants in their everyday activity spaces a) show strong internal consistency among multiple measures of crime fear; b) indicate that perceptual measures of social cohesion are significant predictors of victimisation worry; and c) support most hypothesised associations between concepts contained in contemporary models of crime fear. Unfortunately, some aspects of the pilot study design could not be implemented as planned, which have implications for future research.

	abstract = {Interest in Lévy walks within the context of movement of organisms has recently soared, with some now referring to this approach as the Lévy walk/flight paradigm. The principal assumptions, taken from the world of physics, have been that organisms searching for food or some other resource adopt random walks, whereby the direction of each successive step in the walk is chosen at random from the complete circle and the length of each step, unless terminated through resource encounter, is chosen from a Lévy probability distribution with a particular exponent μ. The additional assumption that organisms forage optimally, such that μ maximizes the rate of resource encounter, has led to the so-called Lévy foraging hypothesis, with many attempts to test it. However, the Lévy walk model is unrealistic, especially as it omits directionality between successive steps, a typical feature of movements of individual organisms at spatial scales relevant to their movement decisions. It also results in lower foraging efficiency than other more realistic models and the evidence that organisms actually ‘do the Lévy walk’ is weak to non-existent, despite claims to the contrary. Early optimal foraging studies of movements of organisms and a new generation of movement models avoid these problems. It is therefore time to divorce the Lévy walk model from optimal foraging theory, revisit some of the early optimal foraging studies of movements and pursue the new generation of movement models. However, the Lévy approach may still prove useful at relatively large spatial scales, in terms of both theory and observations, especially in relation to distribution, dispersal and other population-level phenomena, and in this way biology, physics and mathematics may yet work well together.},

	volume = {404},
	abstract = {Animals must balance their rates of energetic intake and expenditure while foraging. Several mathematical models have been put forward as energetically optimal foraging strategies when the food environment is sparse (i.e., the distance between food patches in the environment is much larger than the distance from which the forager can perceive food). In particular, Lévy walks with a power law exponent approaching 1 are considered optimal for destructive foragers. However, these models have yet to explore the role of sensory perception in foraging success as the distance between food patches approaches the distance from which the forager can perceive food. Here, we used an agent-based modeling approach to address this question. Our results concur that lower values of the power law exponent (i.e. values approaching 1) result in the most food found, but in contrast to previous studies, we note that, in many cases, lower exponents are not optimal when we consider food found per unit distance traveled. For example, higher values of the exponent resulted in comparable or higher foraging success relative to lower values when the forager's range of sensory perception was restricted to an angle ± 30° from its current heading. In addition, we find that sensory perception has a larger effect on foraging success than the power law exponent. These results suggest that a deeper examination of how animals perceive food sources from a distance may affect longstanding assumptions regarding the optimality of Lévy walk foraging patterns, and lend support to the developing theoretical shift towards models that place increasing emphasis on how organisms interact with their environments.},

Although this pathway is composed of just a few components, it exhibits some essential characteristics of biological complexity, such as adaptation and response to environmental signals1. In studying intracellular networks, most experiments and mathematical models2,3,4,5 have assumed that network properties can be inferred from population measurements. However, this approach masks underlying temporal fluctuations of intracellular signalling events. We have inferred fundamental properties of the chemotaxis network from a noise analysis of behavioural variations in individual bacteria. Here we show that certain properties established by population measurements, such as adapted states, are not conserved at the single-cell level: for timescales ranging from seconds to several minutes, the behaviour of non-stimulated cells exhibit temporal variations much larger than the expected statistical fluctuations. We find that the signalling network itself causes this noise and identify the molecular events that produce it. Small changes in the concentration of one key network component suppress temporal behavioural variability, suggesting that such variability is a selected property of this adaptive system.},

	abstract = {A new aspect of the regulation of the bacterial flagellar motor is described. Protonmotive force, i.e. proton electrochemical potential across the cell membrane, not only drives motility, but was found to exert a regulatory effect on the switching of the motor between counterclockwise and clockwise senses. When motor speed was reduced by reducing protonmotive force (but not when speed was reduced by increasing external load), the motor spent a higher fraction of time in counter-clockwise rotation, although the speed in both senses remained equal; at approximately 80\% of the maximum motor speed under any given external load condition, no detectable clockwise rotation remained in most cells, i.e. the motor no longer reversed and so cells swam without tumbling. The altered state of the motor remained as long as the state of low protonmotive force remained. Therefore the phenomenon was not a transient tactic response, although it did modify the response to chemotactic stimulation. The regulation of counter-clockwise xxx clockwise switching by protonmotive force appears to be rather general, having been demonstrated in Salmonella, Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. A moderate reduction in protonmotive force from its normal level in actively metabolizing cells did not affect motor reversibility. Motor speed was also unaffected under these conditions (Khan \& Macnab, following paper). The existence of a saturation regime with regard to both speed and reversibility suggests that the regulation of motor switching may involve the actual protons driving the motor. All general chemotaxis mutants tested, including those known to be defective in the chemotactic methylation system, were susceptible to protonmotive force regulation in a manner consistent with their normal steady-state counter-clockwise/clockwise ratio. Even mutants that appear “counterclockwise only” could be made more so upon lowering protonmotive force, in that their capacity for clockwise tactic responses was impaired. Since responses to attractants and repellents do not involve an alteration in speed, we conclude that protonmotive force and chemotactic regulatory inputs to the motor operate in parallel. the clockwise/counterclockwise ratio showed an increasing exponential dependence on motor speed. This was a result of both an increased counterclockwise→clockwise switching probability and a decreased clockwise→counterclockwise switching probability. These probabilities were found to be inversely related, so that their product was roughly independent of motor speed. An examination of the pattern of clockwise/counterclockwise switching in tactically stimulated cells and in chemotactic mutants suggests that this is a fundamental property of the motor, which may indicate that switching events in both directions are under the same controlling mechanism. We suggest that suppression of tumbling in circumstances of metabolic deprivation might have survival value by permitting a more rapid dispersal of a population from a region of scarcity of food or oxygen, even when no local gradient is present.},

By simulating foraging and colonization of E. coli using a single-cell chemotaxis model, we found that different environments selected for different behaviors. The resulting trade-offs show that populations facing diverse environments would ideally diversify behaviors when time for navigation is limited. We show that advantageous diversity can arise from changes in the distribution of protein levels among individuals, which could occur through mutations in gene regulation. We propose experiments to test our prediction that chemotactic diversity in a clonal population could be a selectable trait that enables adaptation to environmental variability.},
